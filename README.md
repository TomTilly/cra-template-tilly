# My Personal CRA Template

Create React App template that builds on [cra-template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template). For ESLint, Wes Bos' ESLint setup + some of my personal overrides. Prettier is used for non-JS files. Testing features from `cra-template` has been removed for the time being.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo

2. `cd` to where you want to create the next react app

3. Run `npx create-react-app my-app --template file:./path/to/the/template/cra-template-tilly`
