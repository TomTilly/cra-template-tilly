# My Personal CRA Template

Create React App template that builds on [cra-template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template). For ESLint, Wes Bos' ESLint setup + some of my personal overrides. Prettier is used for non-JS files. Testing features from `cra-template` has been removed for the time being.
